        "You can achieve a maximum of 80 marks, you need 32 marks to pass. You should attempt all questions. You should write your code and provide your answers in a Jupyter Notebook. All answers should include clear comments explaining the code. Ensure your code is runnable and free of syntax errors. You are allowed to use built-in functions where appropriate. Submit the Jupyter Notebook (*.ipynb) to the NOW module Dropbox. This coursework is an element of assessment which means you need to pass it in order to pass the module. All work will be submitted to Turnitin as a means to check for plagiarism. Plagiarism will not be tolerated, students are reminded that this is an individual assignment.\n"
